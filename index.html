<br> 
<p> I began my career in real estate at 16 years old, as an assistant - <p/>
  <br>
<p>Within 3 years, I successfully got my foot in the door of New York<p/>
  <br>
<p>working with medical office space in Manhattan & Long Island. <p/>
<br>
       <br>
<p>I soon came to manage a Retail ("BigBox") Real Estate portfolio in over 10 States -<p/>
  <br>
<p>Including Texas, Florida, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Kansas, Ohio,<p/>
  <br>
<p>Connecticut, and Mississippi.<p/>
       <br>
       <br>

<p>Seeing the reach and power of digital marketing in Real Estate,
I am now pursuing an education in Software Engineering to bring
new ideas to the field.<p/>
