            Management And Marketing Retail/BigBox Real Estate
          
          </h2>

<br> 
<p> I began my career in real estate at 16 years old, as an assistant - <br>
 
Within 3 years, I successfully got my foot in the door of New York <br>
 
working with medical office space in Manhattan & Long Island. 
             <p/>

       
       <p>I soon came to manage a Retail ("BigBox") Real Estate portfolio in over 10 States - <br>
Including Texas, Florida, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Kansas, Ohio, <br>
Connecticut, and Mississippi.
            <p/>
      
      

<p>Seeing the reach and power of digital marketing in Real Estate, <br>
I am now pursuing an education in Software Engineering to bring <br>
new ideas to the field.<p/>
